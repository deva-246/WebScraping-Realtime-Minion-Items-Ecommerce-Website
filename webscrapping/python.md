## Web Scrapping using python

There are other popular programming languages, but why we choose the Python over other programming languages for web scraping, due to a list of Python's features that make the most useful programming language for web scrapping.

•	**Dynamically Typed**
In Python, we don't need to define data types for variables; we can directly use the variable wherever it requires. It saves time and makes a task faster. Python defines its classes to identify the data type of variable.

•	**Vast collection of libraries**
Python comes with an extensive range of libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Scipy, etc., that provide flexibility to work with various purposes. It is suited for almost every emerging field and also for web scrapping for extracting data and do manipulation.

•	**Less Code**
The purpose of the web scrapping is to save time. But what if you spend more time in writing the code? That's why we use Python, as it can perform a task in a few lines of code.

•	**Open-Source Community**
Python is open-source, which means it is freely available for everyone. It has one of the biggest communities across the world where you can seek help if you get stuck anywhere in Python code.
